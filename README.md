Assignment 1

Java class(es) with implementation
o Calculating the numerical integral
o Plot original function
o Calculate absolut and relative error (in %) in relation to the manual calculated 
integral
 Java class(es) for testing

Exact result (not the calculation process) of the integration (see 3.2)
 Plot of the function P(t) (see 3.1)
 Nassi-Schneiderman diagrams for all three algorithms stated in 3.3
 UML-diagram(s) for the software structure
 Results of the numerical integration
 Visualization of the integral according to figure 1, 2, and 3 (blue area)
 Absolut and relative error of the numerical results.

Calculate at least 10 grid points per second and plot the function P(t) in the range of 20 second.

Calculate the analytical integral of P(t) by hand.
